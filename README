Assignment 4 - simrake
Taylan K. Sen


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this assignment, you will implement a simple version of Rake called 
SimRake, which is used in the same way as Rake but includes a subset of 
Rake constructs.

simrake should be as close to rake as possible
 it should:
    -detect and abort on circular dependencies
    -only run each task once, even if it's a dependency for more than one other
    task be able to run multiple tasks with the same name but different bodies
    (should run all tasks when the name is used, in the order they were 
    defined) 
    -handle other cases the same way rake does


For extra credit you can also implement the file/time dependence of file tasks 
that is present in standard rake.
